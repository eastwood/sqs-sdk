## Amazon SQS

SQS SDK is designed to be a formidable javascript library, providing an extremely easy to use wrapper around the official AWS-SDK.

This library specifically aims to provide the following features:

- Putting attachments in S3 that are too big for the SQS message limit
- Pulling messages from SQS and fetching their attachments from S3
- Long polling SQS queues

Contributions are welcome as always and if you would like additional functionality, please feel free to open an issue.
